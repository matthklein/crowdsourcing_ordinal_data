# crowdsourcing_ordinal_data

These files can be used to conduct an online survey for collecting ordinal data. I used them to collect 
statements of the kind "Object A is the most central object within the triple of objects (A,B,C)" for a 
data set. See http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-061/16-061.pdf for the relevance of this kind of data
and a description of the survey (Section 6.2).
