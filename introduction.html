		<h1>Survey for collecting relative similarity judgements</h1>
		
		<p> In this survey you should provide relative similarity judgements by choosing the most representative/most 
		central object within a set of three objects.
		</p>	
			
		
		<br>
		
		<p>
		Consider the following <b>example</b>:
		
		<br>
		<br>
		In the following three images you are shown a circle, a square and a square with rounded corners.
		</p>
		
		
		<img  src="disk.jpg"  style="margin: 28px; width: 11%; height: auto;">
		<img   src="square.jpg"  style="margin: 28px; width: 11%; height: auto;">
		<img   src="rounded_square.jpg"  style="margin: 28px; width: 11%; height: auto;">
		
		<p>Clearly, most people would agree that the the square with the rounded corners is the most central 
		object within these three objects: it is more similar to the circle than the ordinary square is, but 
		it is also more similar to the square than the circle is.</p>
		
		<p>In the survey you are shown several triplets of images of cars. For each triplet you should choose the most
		 central car by clicking on it. Clearly, other than in the above example, there will be situations in which there is no obvious most central car. 
		 In such a situation just click on the car which you perceive to be most central.</p>
		 
		 <p><b>Please note that you should assess the similarity between the shown cars and not between the images, that means you should not consider
		  differences in the quality, view, lighting, ... of the images or differences in their background, etc.</b></p>
		
		<p>You will be shown 50 triplets, then you are done with one round of the survey. However, I will really appreciate if you do more than one round :-) </p>
