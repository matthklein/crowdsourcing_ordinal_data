		<p>Assume we are dealing with three objects, say object A, object B and object C. Assume we have some notion of assessing similarity 
		between these objects, that is we could assign some numbers quantifying how similar two of the three objects are to each other.</p>
		
		<p>Let us denote these numbers by <i>similarity(A,B)</i>, <i>similarity(A,C)</i> and <i>similarity(B,C)</i>. A high value of 
		<i>similarity(A,B)</i> means that 
		objects A and B are very similar to each other whereas a low value means that they are quite dissimilar. The numbers
		 <i>similarity(A,C)</i> and <i>similarity(B,C)</i> have a similar meaning.</p>
		 
		 <p>We say that object A is the most representative/most central object within the objects A, B and C if it holds that <br>
		 
		 <center><i>similarity(A,B)</i> &gt <i>similarity(B,C)</i> &nbsp &nbsp AND &nbsp &nbsp <i>similarity(A,C)</i> &gt <i>similarity(B,C)</i>. </center>
		 
		 </p>
		 
		 
		 <br>
		 		 
		 <p>
		Consider the following <b>example</b>:
		
		<br>
		<br>
		In the following three images you are shown sneakers, rubber boots and slippers.
		</p>
		
		
		<img  src="sneakers.jpg"  style="margin: 28px; width: 20%; height: auto;">
		<img   src="boots.jpg"  style="margin: 28px; width: 20%; height: auto;">
		<img   src="slippers.jpg"  style="margin: 28px; width: 20%; height: auto;">
		
		<p>All of them are shoes. Clearly, the rubber boots and the slippers are very dissimilar, but the sneakers are 
		not so dissimilar from either the rubber boots or the slippers. Hence <i>similarity(sneakers,rubber boots)</i> &gt <i>similarity(rubber boots,slippers)</i> 
		and <i>similarity(sneakers,slippers)</i> &gt <i>similarity(rubber boots,slippers)</i>. The sneakers are the most central object!</p>
		
		<br>
		<p>In the survey you should determine the most central object in a triplet of cars. 
		Of course, in most cases (perhaps in all?) there is no <i>true</i> answer. Your answer depends on how you perceive and assess similarity between cars!</p>
